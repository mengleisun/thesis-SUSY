%     This is a LaTex template to be used for a PhD thesis in the
%     Department of Physics at Carnegie Mellon University. It is 
%     recommended to input individual chapters, appendices, etc
%     as separate files. To avoid having to provide multiple files
%     with this template, simple examples for such separate files
%     are included with this template.
