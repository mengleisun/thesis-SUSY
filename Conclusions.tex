\chapter{Conclusions}
\label{sec:conclusions}
In this note, we presented a search for SUSY with general gauge mediation in events with at least one lepton, one photon and large missing transverse momentum. This analysis is based on a sample of proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s} =$ 13 TeV corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35.87 $fb^{-1}$ collected in 2016. The SM backgrounds are estimated using control samples and MC simulations. No significant excess was observed in the signal region, and the results are interpreted in simplified models motivated by gauge-mediated supersymmetry breaking. For TChiWg model, where $\PSGczDo\PSGcpmDo$ are pair produced, NLSP of mass up to 900 GeV is excluded. For strong productions, gluino up to 1700 GeV and squark up to 1400 GeV can be excluded.
